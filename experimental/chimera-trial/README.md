# neutralinojs-minimal-app for chimera
Ok so as of writing this, I think that this demo might be the move in terms of development.
This can make it astronomically easier to send requests back to the native system, and 
honestly, I would much rather work with neutralino given that I don't have to change tauri 
backend. In retrospect, this means that before spending time down a specific route, we should
always stress test the different options in regards to what EXACTLY we need.
